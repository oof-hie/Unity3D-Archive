# Unity3D Web Player Archive

An archive of games built on the Unity Web Player.

## About This Archive

This repository aims to preserve old games built on the now deprecated Unity Web Player, which was widely used in older browser games. As NPAPI is universally unsupported and many browser game hosting websites are deleting these files from their servers, this archive is an effort to save these games. Currently, all files are sourced from Y8.com's servers, as it is one of the few websites that still hosts these files.

A copy of a software called "GameLoad" is also bundled with this archive. This program lets you play these web player games locally.

## How to Archive Your Own Files

### Prerequisites

- A web browser

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

1. Go to a website that still hosts games built on Unity Web Player (for this example, we will use Y8.com).
   
   ![Step 1](https://github.com/oof-hie/Unity3D-Archive/assets/74454909/441f363d-70bc-45c5-a743-a298f1ed887e)

2. Open the developer console using F12 on your keyboard.
   
   ![Step 2](https://github.com/oof-hie/Unity3D-Archive/assets/74454909/2545416c-3f19-410f-859b-f94430b28c98)

3. Type in ".unity3d" in the HTML search bar in the "Inspect" tab of the console.
   
   ![Step 3](https://github.com/oof-hie/Unity3D-Archive/assets/74454909/e176560c-d7bb-4420-ac1d-7a48ec4c5ae8)

4. Search for a file in an HTML element by continuously pressing enter that has the name of your game (most of the time) and ends in .unity3d (on Y8 this is always a big block of code).
   
   ![Step 4](https://github.com/oof-hie/Unity3D-Archive/assets/74454909/87223f0b-70b7-4a85-ada1-4847464a86a2)

5. Copy everything from `https://` to the `.unity3d` file extension by double-clicking the highlighted block of code, selecting the link, and pressing `Ctrl + C`.
   
   ![Step 5](https://github.com/oof-hie/Unity3D-Archive/assets/74454909/3d5311b8-0b14-4d20-b049-daf6e665cec4)

6. Paste it in the address bar of your browser, click enter, and the game should automatically download.
